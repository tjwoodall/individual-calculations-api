      Here a developer can:
        - list self-assessment tax calculations for a given National Insurance number (NINO) and tax year
        - trigger a self-assessment tax calculation for a given tax year
        - retrieve all the tax calculation data for a given NINO and Calculation ID
  - name: Final Declaration
    description: |
      **Final declaration was previously called crystallisation.**

      This resource allows software packages to make a final declaration regarding a customer’s end of year position for a tax year.

      Before starting the final declaration journey the software package will need to ensure that, for the relevant tax year, the customer:
        - has already provided their entire income e.g. interest, dividends, other SA schedules
        - does not have any additional information to provide

      Here, the developer can:      
        - submit final declaration for a tax year

      summary: Trigger a Self Assessment Tax Calculation
      description: |
        This endpoint allows the user to trigger a self assessment tax calculation for a given tax year. 
        It should be called whenever income data is updated through a periodic or annual endpoint. 
        To trigger a final declaration self assessment tax calculation,
        you must set the calculationType path parameter to intent-to-finalise.

        A National Insurance number and tax year must be provided. 

        The tax calculation process is asynchronous, so it is recommended you wait at least 5 seconds 
        before calling the retrieval endpoint. 
        The result of the calculation can be seen using the 
        “Retrieve a Self Assessment Tax Calculation” endpoint.
